# Prerequisites

## Installing the build tool

This tutorial uses npm as a build tool. You need to have Node.js installed in your computer. You can find instructions on [how to install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) in the official website.

To download the latest version of npm, on the command line, run the following command:

```
npm install -g npm
```

Check that is working:

```
npm -v
```

## Installing the application dependencies

```
cd modern-web-app
npm install
```
